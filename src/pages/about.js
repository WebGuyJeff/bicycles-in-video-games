            <p> 
                Hunting bicycles in games is a long-term interest of mine. The bicycle is naturally a
                gentlemen's invention and is regarded, by those with class, to be the pinnacle of modern
                sophistication. To discover a bicycle in a videogame is to get a deep insight into the
                developer's psyche. Crude, or painstakingly crafted, taking the time to appreciate a VG bike
                always brings a high-poly tear to my eye.
