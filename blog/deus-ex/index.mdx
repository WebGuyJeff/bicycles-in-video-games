Deus Ex is a game set in a dystopian future of mass-corruption, nestled in a seedy cyberpunk
metropolis. With human augmentation at the peak of controversy it's a surprise the bicycle featured
in mankind divided isn't a little more extreme in it's design, however, it does play to the games
'believability' which is something I always admired about the Deus world.

Speaking of realism, this is kinda cool: The 'bike docks' in Deus are a real thing! I have no idea
if the modelling was 'officially' based on the real product, but once you see them there's no doubt
the model is a carbon copy of the [Streetpod by Cyclepods](https://www.cyclepods.co.uk/streetpod/).
The manufacturer also mentions this [on their site](https://www.cyclepods.co.uk/deus-ex-streetpods/)
and get this @America - no lawsuit!

The bikes, which are copy/pasted all over the place are often seen considerately replaced in their
Streetpods. They're of monocoque construction and loosely reminiscent of the Giant Box One. This
design is also becoming familiar in newer e-bike design. I guess they guessed good.

Some of my **favourite** features are:
* Vintage style rear mudguard and complete lack of front mudguard.
* Boris Bike (London) handlebars.
* Did I mention the Streetpods are REAL?
