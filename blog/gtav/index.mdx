No surprises here, Rockstar have a pretty accurate representation of a contemporary MTB albeit the
headtube gusset Ã  la 90s. The long travel fork and slack hardtail frame make it clear this is a
hardcore DJ/trail bike. Beyond that, there's not much to note of interest.

Some of my **favourite** features are:
* Insanely long headtube - wtf is that thing a hammerhead shark?
* The huge bottom bracket shell, perhaps concentric or old-school US BMX?
* Responsible addition of the rear-reflector.
