Fallout got it right again with a true-to-period 1930s women's shopping bicycle. It resembles
a British Raleigh of the era complete with Brooks B66-style leather saddle and butchers front pannier
rack. The low-spoke wheels let us know the owner was keen to save a few grams off this 30kg lump of
high-quality steel - or perhaps just a few polys.

Some of my **favourite** features are:
* V-brake levers on a rod pull bike (Halfords service?).
* Accuracy is genuinely impressive.
* Variation of full vs hockey stick chainguard also very realistic.
