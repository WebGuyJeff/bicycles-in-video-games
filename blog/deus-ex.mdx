Deus Ex is a game set in a dystopian future of mass-corruption, nestled in a seedy cyberpunk
metropolis. With human augmentation at the peak of controversy it's a surprise the bicycle featured
in mankind divided isn't a little more extreme in it's design, however, it does play to the games
'believability' which is something I always admired about the Deus world.

The bikes, which are ctrl+V'd all over the place are often seen considerately replaced in their
bike dock are of monocoque construction and loosely reminiscent of the Giant Box One. This design
is also becoming familiar in newer e-bike design. I guess they guessed good.

Some of my **favourite** features are:
* Vintage style rear mudguard and complete lack of front mudguard.
* Boris Bike (London) handlebars.
* 90s mag wheels.
